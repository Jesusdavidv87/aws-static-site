# AWS Static Website Project ðŸš€

## Project Goal
Host a static website on **Amazon S3** fronted by **CloudFront**, with future CI/CD via **GitHub Actions**. 
This repo will serve as evidence of hands-on AWS skills for Solutions Architect Associate prep.

## Day 1 Log (2025-08-28)
- Created GitHub repo `aws-static-site`

- Launched a Free Tier EC2 instance for practice and environment setup (SSH tested)

## Architecture (target for Week 1)
- S3 for static site hosting
- CloudFront for CDN + HTTPS
- IAM for least-privilege deployment access
- (Later) GitHub Actions to deploy on push

## Project Structure (initial)
```

```

## Next Steps
- Day 2: Create S3 bucket, enable static website hosting, upload `index.html`
