# AWS Static Website Project ðŸš€

## Project Goal
Host a static website on **Amazon S3** fronted by **CloudFront**, with future CI/CD via **GitHub Actions**. 
This repo will serve as evidence of hands-on AWS skills for Solutions Architect Associate prep.

## Day 1 Log (2025-08-28)
- Created GitHub repo `aws-static-site`
- Set project goals and structure
- Launched a Free Tier EC2 instance for practice and environment setup (SSH tested)

## Architecture (target for Week 1)
- S3 for static site hosting
- CloudFront for CDN + HTTPS
- IAM for least-privilege deployment access
- (Later) GitHub Actions to deploy on push

## Project Structure (initial)
```
aws-static-site/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Next Steps
- Day 2: Create S3 bucket, enable static website hosting, upload `index.html`
- Day 3: Add CloudFront distribution
- Day 4+: Add GitHub Actions, screenshots, and a diagram

- Created S3 bucket and enabled static website hosting.
- Applied bucket policy for public GET access.
- Uploaded `index.html` and verified website endpoint.
- âœ… Website live: http://aws-static-site-jesusdavidv87.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

## Day 3 Achievements (2025-08-30)
- Deployed CloudFront distribution in front of S3.
- Configured Default Root Object (index.html).

## Day 4 Achievements (2025-08-31)
- Completed IAM basics (Skill Builder labs).
- Set up IAM role with OIDC provider for GitHub Actions.
- Prepared GitHub Actions workflow for secure deploys.
- Configured GitHub â†’ AWS deployment using OIDC for best practices:
- No static credentials stored in the repository.
- Short-lived IAM role assumed at build time.
- Least privilege access (restricted to S3 + CloudFront).
-  Automatic credential rotation managed by AWS.

# Day 5 â€“ IAM Policies & Security

## Key Concepts
- **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**: AWS service for controlling access to resources.
- **IAM User**: An individual identity with credentials.
- **IAM Roles**: Identities assumed by services or applications (e.g., GitHub Actions with OIDC).
- **Policies**: JSON documents that define permissions (allow/deny).
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Always grant only the permissions needed.

## Example â€“ S3 Read-Only Policy
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::aws-static-site-jesusdavidv87/*"]
    }
  ]
